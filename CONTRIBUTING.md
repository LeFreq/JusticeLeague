Project ideas should be written up with a TITLE, DESCRIPTION, IMPLEMENTATION, and suggested USAGE.  The first two are mandatory.  If can't get that much, start a project using the project tab.

TITLEs should be of the kind that you might engrave on an ink stamp.  The initial word "PROJECT" is already implied in the title and shouldn't be included.   So avoid project names like "*PROJECT* SEED BOMB".  Also, avoid names on which you can't deliver like "GLOBAL LIBERATION", "TANTRIC MASTER", "IRAQI FREEDOM", and such. 

Project DESCRIPTION should be abstract prose written to give a quick idea of the concept and entice the reader into the happy places the reader will be led if they make your project.

IMPLEMENTATION can include electronic schematics, gifs of drawings for how to implement your remote spray-paint device, microcontroller code, DTMF tone lists, etc.

USAGE suggestions section is for maximizing the utility to other friends of the cause (in Spanish: revoluci√≥n).  Video taping, contacting the press, "customer" and device-placement strategies, and things to do after project finish.

Minimize heavy use of "creative" fonts and superfluous pictures.  Projects never use the word "I".  Because there isn't an "i" in T.E.A.M.:  To Exemplify All Mischief.
