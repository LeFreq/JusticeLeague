TITLE:

Operation Crying Fowl

DESCRIPTION:

Those shiny cars scream of vanity and excess.  Did America get fixed when we weren't looking, and now all of those freedom fighters can form their parade of victory?  Nope.  

Bird droppings make good use of it.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Get on the roof of a car dealership (legally) and spread some pigeon feed around.
