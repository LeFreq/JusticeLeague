All those women's magazines?  Opportunity knocks.

Consider these headlines from "Woman's World":
*Holiday Party Fun!  In the nude!
*Lose 22lbs -- without dieting!  Asian "carb sponge" mops up calories!  Hmm, hmm, I know what else burns calories
*Cure a sore throat!  with peas!  a little :ws word switch goes a loong way here

You can do better.
