DESCRIPTION:

All those women's magazines?  Opportunity knocks. 

IMPLEMENTATION:



USAGE:

Consider these headlines from "Woman's World":
*"Holiday Party Fun!"  

...in the nude, maybe

*"Lose 22lbs -- without dieting!  Asian 'carb sponge' mops up calories!"  

Hmm, hmm, I know what else burns calories

*"Cure a sore throat!  with peas!"  

a little :ws word switch goes a loong way here

You can do better.
