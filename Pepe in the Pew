Low-impact version, but worth a view.  See also the project "what's that smell?"

Build or buy a remote-controlled audio playback device.  Record some quality fart/expletives/machine noises onto the device and place it where no one will find it:  under a church pew, legislative chambers, at work.

USAGE SUGGESTIONS:
Use sparingly and away enough where your phun will not expose yourself.
