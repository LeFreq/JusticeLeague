TITLE: Phaedrus

DESCRIPTION:

The righteous wo/man can't content himself with the pleasantries of modern society.  Subconsiously or not, s/he knows that the system is a giant Titanic that will be hitting the iceberg soon.  Everyone is dependent on the system.   There are few life rafts.  This is your chance.

IMPLEMTATION:

Hackerlofts filled with people becoming independent of the system.  A Pangaia board for suggesting ideas, quests, bounties, and tasks to get done.  People honing their lives to a pinpoint of precision capable of feeding themselves, settling disagreements amicably, building shelters together, and making love.

ACKS:

Pirsig, Robert, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.
