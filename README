FEELING THE LOSS OF HUMAN POTENTIAL?  WELCOME TO THE FIGHT CLUB.

Note:  If you are a young'n, get out of here and go check out the Jedi Path on the wiki.  We, here at the fight club, don't want you to get in trouble.  That's why is says "FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY".  'k?

So you want to change the world, free some stagnant capital, maybe kick a few asses down the block.  You'll need a path.  Most who try it on their own end up in jail, get lost in their own ego, or rejected for doing it the stupidest way possible.   How do you know I'll lead you any better?  You don't, but Fight Club is for people willing to take a chance on their fellow human beings.  ACCEPT IT.

Maybe you don't want to be a cow anymore on the consumer feedlot of American GDP.  Perhaps you're tired of your support group telling you how powerless you are.  Or maybe you're feeling a little sore from being "wide receiver" at your job on planet America.  WELCOME TO FIGHT CLUB.

"This is not about fighting your neighbor, unless your neighbot is total jerk.  No, at Fight Club, we add order to anarchy." -- fight club founder
"When you have a retarded elephant running off of a cliff, sometimes you have to hurl rocks at it to change its course." -- IRA brother
"In no way is Chuck Palahnuik, or github.com responsible for this content, nor am I saving your ass if you do something stupid.  Before you realize that you are solely responsible for getting yourself and anyone else hurt, you need to contact me."  -- the author

If you don't know the movie "Fight Club" with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, go see it, so you know a little what this repo is about.

The Apocalypse is coming and it has come for the winners on Team Mediocre.  This repo is for the LOSERS of that battle -- you and me.  This repo holds project ideas for reclaiming the world and yourself.  They might be electronics projects, reaquisitions of the creative commons, tools to become enlightened, perhaps some righteous payback.  

There's a lot to consider when jumping off the runaway train of G8 culture:

* honing your life to a pinpoint by going straight-edge, 
* engaging in tactical acts of "cultural correction",
* squatting/occupying an abandoned house or warehouse to preserve its value and make new (i.e. upcycling!), and
* making your own food, from seed, demonstrating *initiative* and *independence*,
* taking responsibility for the safety of others by acquiring massive knowledge of the syst3m,
* composting your waste or other outputs so that no one can blame you for making it harder for anyone else,
* creating a alternative economy that subv3rts the vanity of modern consumer culture
* by being completely *independent*, getting smarter, stronger, harder.   We have a sound track (check the wiki).

Join up, by opening an issue above on the repo and a fellow brother will contact you.

IN THE REPO, you will find a document called HEADLINE_TARGETS.  These have the means for which your sorry ass can earn some major karmic returns.  Bounties will be placed on these and you can collect these to add status to your team.  Here, like when one faces their death, you'll have to walk an edge so fine that no one can cut you down. It takes Truth to win -- become enlightened on the wiki there at the top bar.

Creatives and intellectuals needs a little help, because in this world, there's little space for those who are smarter than a monkey or more independent than a cow.  You're lucky if you get to sit in the park after dark to philosophize.  Most of the righteous are sitting in jails, lying in the gutter, carving out secret dreams in the basement, or marginalized to "those people" in foreign countries because "those people" refused to take part of the G8 program.

No, these here files are for the true freedom-fighters, the revolutionaries of justice, liberators of enslaved assets, and revivifyers of the comfortably numb.  

What we are not:  destroyers of assets, harrassers of the weak, takers from the poor, drug users who don't want to fix the world, or passive-aggressive pansies afraid of speaking out.

Here on github, we wouldn't dream of re-creating the behaviors of our leaders:  taking the law into our own hands or engaging in questionable behavior, ignoring the problems of the world.  No.  We aim to be better: to reclaim our law for the People, and engage only in acts that defend the principles of liberty and justice for all.  Perhaps it may seem questionable to lessor minds...  Enlist them.

These materials have all of the authroity of Tyler Durden.  Those who come up with the best file-names get an automatic 10 credits in the Pangaia World Game.  There's no violence. The violence has already occurred against the soul.  They've taken your right to live, to provide for yourself, to make culture without requiring permission.  ***Be sure to explore the wiki up there on the github project's menu bar.***  Share what you know.
