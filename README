FEELING THE WASTE OF HUMAN POTENTIAL?  WELCOME TO THE FIGHT CLUB.

"This is not about fighting your neighbor, unless your neighbot is total jerk.  No, our purpose is to ADD order to the anarchy." -- fight club founder

Mulled by the jetskis of the American Left/Right?  Bored of your JCPenny/GAP lifestyle of sitting at coffee shops, dressing well, and fiddling with new relationship ideas?  Need a kick in the ass to feel righteous again, a homework ASSignment to fix your karma, or perhaps you're a little bored with your 9 to 5 and your arse is feeling sore from being wide receiver on PLANET AMERICA?  Welcome.

If you don't know the movie "Fight Club" with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, go see it, so you know a little what this repo is about.

The Apocalypse is coming and it has come for the winners on Team Mediocre.  This repo is for the LOSERS of that battle -- you and me.  This repo holds project ideas for reclaiming the world and yourself.  They might be electronics projects, reaquisitions of the creative commons, tools to become enlightened, perhaps some righteous payback.

There's a lot to consider when jumping off the runaway train of G8 culture:

* honing your life to a pinpoint of precision by going straight-edge, 
* engaging in tactical acts of "cultural correction",
* making your own food, from seed, demonstrating *initiative* and *independence*,
* taking responsibility for the safety of others by acquiring massive knowledge of the syst3m,
* composting your waste or other outputs so that no one can blame you for making it harder for someone else,
* creating a alternative economy that subv3rts the vanity of modern amerika
* squatting/occupying an abandoned house or warehouse to preserve its value and make new (i.e. upcycling!), and
* by being completely *independent*, getting smarter, stronger, and *harder*.

Here, you're going to walk an edge so fine that no one can cut you down. It takes Truth to win, though.  We've got it; become enlightened on the wiki there at the top bar.

Creatives and intellectuals needs a little help, because in this world, there's little space for those who are smarter than a monkey or more independent than a cow.  You're lucky if you get to sit in the park after dark to philosophize.  Most of the righteous are sitting in jails, lying in the gutter, carving out secret dreams in the basement, or marginalized to "those people" in foreign countries because "those people" refused to take part of the G8 program.

No, these here files are for the true freedom-fighters, the revolutionaries of justice, liberators of enslaved capital, and revivifyers of the comfortably numb.  

What we are not:  destroyers of assets, harrassers of the weak, takers from the poor, drug users who don't want to fix the world, or passive-aggressive pansies that are afraid of speaking out.

Here on github, we wouldn't dream of re-creating the behaviors of our leaders:  taking the law into our own hands or engaging in questionable behavior, ignoring the problems of the world.  No.  We aim to be better: to reclaim our law for the People, and engage only in acts that defend the principles of liberty and justice for all.  Perhaps it may seem questionable to lessor minds...  Enlist them.

There's no violence. The violence has already occurred against the soul.  They've taken your right to live, to provide for yourself, to make culture without requiring permission.  ***Be sure to explore the wiki and project boards.***  There aren't too many culture-jamming philes yet.  Share what you know.
