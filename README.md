Project Total Freedom

So, you got caught under the horseshit of the liberal Left and the Republican right, eh?  Need a little mojo to feel righteous again, a job for your karma to be cleansed, or perhaps a little bored with your 9 to 5 and your ass feeling a little sore?  Welcome.

Creatives and intellectuals needs a little help, because in this world, there's they leave just a little room for the righteous.  Most of them are sitting in jails, lying in the gutter, or marginalized to "those people" on TV because those people refused to take part of the bounty of America.

Now, these here files are for the true freedom fighters, the revolutionaries of justice, liberators of imprisoned capital, and awakeners of the sleepers of the world.  

What we are not:  destroyers of assets, commiters of cruel acts

Consider:

* occupying an abandoned house or warehouse to make new value and preserving the old (i.e. recycling),
* making their own food, from seed, demonstrating *initiative* and *independence*, fruitfulness,
* creating a subver5ive economy that undercuts the vanity of modern amerika (without hurting anyone (without their consent)),
* engaging in tactical acts of cultural correction,
* taking responsibility for the safety of others by massive knowledge of the syst3m, and
* by being completely *independent* and *drug-free*, getting smarter, stronger, and *harder*.

Here, you're going to walk the line so finely that no one can cut you down. It takes truth to win, though.

After fighting here, everything in your life will get the volume turned down.  You won't be interested in your smart phone, your audi 5000, that triple-filtered elite coffee shop in old town.

Here on github, we wouldn't dream of acting like the leaders of our nations:  taking the law into our own hands, or engaging in criminal behavior for which we're not willing to be held accountable. No.  We aim to be better: to reclaim our law for the People, and engage only in acts that defend the principles of liberty and justice for all.  Perhaps it all seems questionable to lessor minds.  Enlist them.

There's no violence. The violence has already occurred against the soul.  It's getting purified.
