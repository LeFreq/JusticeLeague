"...many who are first will be last, and the last first" --Gospel of Matthew

So, you've been mulled by the jetskis of the American Left and Right?  Need a little push to feel righteous again, a task to fix your karma, or perhaps a little bored with your 9 to 5 and your ass is feeling a little sore from being wide receiver on PLANET AMERICA?  Welcome.

The Apocalypse is coming, and it's coming for the winners on TEAM MEDIOCRE.  Those assholes always win.  This is for those who haven't been winning.  No, this repo is for the LOSERS.  That's probably you and me.  Now you're part of the club:  Club Enc√∫ler.

This repo holds project ideas for reclaiming the world and yourself.  They might be electronics projects, requisitions of the creative commons, tools to become enlightened, perhaps some righteous payback.

Creatives and intellectuals needs a little help, because in this world, there's little space for those who are smarter than a monkey or more independent than a cow.  You're lucky if you get to sit in the park after dark to philosophize.  Most of the righteous are sitting in jails, lying in the gutter, carving out secret dreams in the basement, or marginalized to "those people" on TV because "those people" refused to take part of the G8 lifestyle.

No, these here files are for the true freedom fighters, the revolutionaries of justice, liberators of enslaved capital, and awakeners of the dead.  

What we are not:  destroyers of (true) assets, harrassers of the (innocently) weakened, takers from the (unjustly) impoverished, drug users who don't know what do with their lives, or passive-aggressive pansies that are afraid of speaking for themselves.

There's a lot to consider when jumping off the runaway train of this culture:

* squatting/occupying an abandoned house or warehouse to preserve its value make and make new (i.e. upcycling!),
* making your own food, from seed, demonstrating *initiative* and *independence*,
* composting your waste or other outputs so that no one can blame you for making it harder for someone else,
* creating a subver5ive economy that undercuts the vanity of modern amerika (without hurting anyone (without their consent)),
* engaging in tactical acts of cultural correction,
* taking responsibility for the safety of others by massive knowledge of the syst3m, and
* by being completely *independent* and *drug-free*, getting smarter, stronger, and *harder*.

Here, you're going to walk the line so finely that no one can cut you down. It takes Truth to win, though.

After fighting for these things, everthing in your life will gain new perspective.  You won't be so interested in your smart phone, your audi 5000, that triple-filtered elite coffee shop over in bougie-town.

Here on github, we wouldn't dream of acting like the leaders of our nations:  taking the law into our own hands, or engaging in questionable behavior for which we're not willing to be held accountable. No.  We aim to be better: to reclaim our law for the People, and engage only in acts that defend the principles of liberty and justice for all.  Perhaps it may seem questionable to lessor minds.  Enlist them.

There's no violence. The violence has already occurred against the soul.  They've taken your right to live, to grow your own healthier food, to make your own entertainment.   It's about getting purified.
