THIS IS FIGHT CLUB.

"This is not about fighting your neighbor, unless your neighbot is total asshole.  No, our purpose is to ADD order to the anarchy.  There is no project mayhem." -- fight flub founder<br>
And Jesus said "many who are first will be last, and the last first." Matt 19:30

Tired of your slacker lifestyle of merely dressing slovenly, sitting at coffee shops, and sleeping around?  Mulled by the jetskis of the American Left/Right?  Need a kick in the ass to feel righteous again, a homework ASSignment to fix your karma, or perhaps you're a little bored with your 9 to 5 and your arse is feeling sore from being wide receiver on PLANET AMERICA?  Welcome.

The Apocalypse is coming, and it has come for the winners on TEAM MEDIOCRE.  Those assholes that always "win".  This repo is for the LOSERS of that battle -- probably you and me.  This repo holds project ideas for reclaiming the world and yourself.  They might be electronics projects, requisitions of the creative commons, tools to become enlightened, perhaps some righteous payback.

Creatives and intellectuals needs a little help, because in this world, there's little space for those who are smarter than a monkey or more independent than a cow.  You're lucky if you get to sit in the park after dark to philosophize.  Most of the righteous are sitting in jails, lying in the gutter, carving out secret dreams in the basement, or marginalized to "those people" on the news because "those people" refused to take part of the G8 program.

No, these here files are for the true freedom fighters, the revolutionaries of justice, liberators of enslaved capital, and revivers of the comfortably numb.  

What we are not:  destroyers of assets, harrassers of the weakened, takers from the impoverished, drug users who don't know what do with their lives, or passive-aggressive pansies that are afraid of speaking for themselves.

There's a lot to consider when jumping off the runaway train of G8 culture:

* honing your life by going straight-edge, 
* squatting/occupying an abandoned house or warehouse to preserve its value make and make new (i.e. upcycling!),
* making your own food, from seed, demonstrating *initiative* and *independence*,
* composting your waste or other outputs so that no one can blame you for making it harder for someone else,
* creating a subver5ive economy that undercuts the vanity of modern amerika (without hurting anyone (without their (unconscious) consent)),
* engaging in tactical acts of cultural correction,
* taking responsibility for the safety of others by massive knowledge of the syst3m, and
* by being completely *independent*, getting smarter, stronger, and *harder*.

Here, you're going to walk the line so finely that no one can cut you down. It takes Truth to win, though.  We've got it.  We might even make you enlightened.

After fighting for these things, everthing in your life will gain new perspective.  You won't be so interested in your smart phone, your audi 5000, that triple-filtered elite coffee shop over in bougie-town, your porn stash.

Here on github, we wouldn't dream of re-creating the behaviors of our leaders:  taking the law into our own hands without a vision, or engaging in questionable behavior for which we're unwilling to be held accountable.  No.  We aim to be better: to reclaim our law for the People, and engage only in acts that defend the principles of liberty and justice for all.  Perhaps it may seem questionable to lessor minds.  Enlist them.

There's no violence. The violence has already occurred against the soul.  They've taken your right to live, to grow your own healthier food, to make your own entertainment.   It's about getting purified.
