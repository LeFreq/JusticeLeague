The Apocalypse is something for the winners on TEAM MEDIOCRE.  It is said in the Gosel of Matthew that "many who are first will be last, and the last first".  This is for those who've felt last in the project of America.

So, you've been mulled in the backwash from the jetskis of the American Left and Right?  Need a little push to feel righteous again, a task to fix your karma, or perhaps a little bored with your 9 to 5 and your ass is feeling a little sore from being wide receiver on TEAM AMERICA?  Welcome.

This repo is for project ideas for reclaiming the world and yourself.  They might be electronics projects, requisitions of the creative commons, perhaps some righteous payback.

Creatives and intellectuals needs a little help, because in this world, there's little space for those who are better than the dominant paradigm.  You're lucky if you get to sit in the park after dark to philosophize.  Most of the righteous are sitting in jails, lying in the gutter, carving out secret dreams in the basement, or marginalized to "those people" on TV because "those people" refused to take part of the lifestyle that is America.

No, these here files are for the true freedom fighters, the revolutionaries of justice, liberators of enslaved capital, and awakeners of the sleepers of the world.  

What we are not:  destroyers of assets, harrassers of the weakened, takers from the impoverished, or passive-aggressive pansies that are afraid of speaking for themselves.

There's a lot to consider when jumping off the runaway train of the G20 economy:

* squatting/occupying an abandoned house or warehouse to preserve its value make and make new (i.e. upcycling!),
* making your own food, from seed, demonstrating *initiative* and *independence*,
* creating a subver5ive economy that undercuts the vanity of modern amerika (without hurting anyone (without their consent)),
* engaging in tactical acts of cultural correction,
* taking responsibility for the safety of others by massive knowledge of the syst3m, and
* by being completely *independent* and *drug-free*, getting smarter, stronger, and *harder*.

Here, you're going to walk the line so finely that no one can cut you down. It takes truth to win, though.

After fighting for these things, everything in your life will get the volume turned down.  You won't be so interested in your smart phone, your audi 5000, that triple-filtered elite coffee shop over in bougie-town.

Here on github, we wouldn't dream of acting like the leaders of our nations:  taking the law into our own hands, or engaging in questionable behavior for which we're not willing to be held accountable. No.  We aim to be better: to reclaim our law for the People, and engage only in acts that defend the principles of liberty and justice for all.  Perhaps it may seem questionable to lessor minds.  Enlist them.

There's no violence. The violence has already occurred against the soul.  It's about getting purified.  Keep this in mind before using *any* medium to address your grievences.
