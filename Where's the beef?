TITLE:  Where's the Beef.

DESCRIPTION:  Women are getting liposuctions at cosmetic doctor's clinics.  We live in a culture of vanity.  Most of that waste is considered biohazards and requires costly disposal.  We here at Fight Club are here to help.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Find your local liposuction clinic and look outside for biohazard signs around dumpsters.  Collect your bounty.

You have to render the fat by heating it up slowly.  Once it turns clear, you can add salt and purfumes, essential (aromatic) oils, and some sodium hydroxide (lye).  Use some FDA-approved dye to turn the soaps color into something you can sell.  Boom, you have your money maker.

CREDS:

Tyler Durden and Mikey Mike.
