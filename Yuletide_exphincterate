TITLE:

DESCRIPTION:

Christmas is a widely-overused time of year.  Why not give the kids some pranks for the holidays, so they can have some fun, too?  Get some stink bombs, itch powder, cigarettes boms, etc. and give-out some stockings.

IMPLENTATION:

Dress as Santa Claus, handing out jolly socks full of our kind of love, plus some candy at the top to foil the parents.
