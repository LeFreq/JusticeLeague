RIGHT TO LIVE

SUMMARY

People have a right to live, but they get arrested if they get caught stealing.  Communities that don't grow food or allocate land for the public, make everything a crime to live simply, whether it's eliminatng waste, eating, sleeping, or getting water.

IMPLEMENTATION

2x3" (or so) cards, haneded out to people on the street, they can place at the nerchant when they need to take something to replace the food that they otherwise would have had, had the community planned better.

This person is bringing to your attention a lack of civil respect to every citizen.  Perhaps they took some food or beverage without paying for it, or perhaps you're reading this because you want them to move off a public (or private) space they're using to sleep.  Do note that it is the People's responsibility to provide alternatives, if they take the natural forms of sustainance away into "private" property.  Thank you for yoru understanding.  If you have questions abou this, or feel this right and noctice was abused, please contact X?

The person who employs this process should leave the card at the place of business preferably before snatching the goods or after enjoying a meal or other service.  Once a merchant has been informed, you needed use it for your personal use, unless you're a member of the Fight Club and ready to argue your case in Court.
