TITLE:  Operation Viral Outbreak

DESCRIPTION:

When people are getting oppressive, send out notes of fear, uncertainty, and doubt to depower them.  Remind them of the dangers of germs and that they should wear masks to protect themselves. 

IMPLEMENTATION:

Provide free masks to show your commitment.  Show pictures of crazy-looking, color-"enhanced", images of them so that they know that they don't have a fucking clue that no one's actually ever seen a germ, under a microscope or not.  

Wearing a special mask that you made from equipment from your local BDSM store to show who has the better protection.
